# Assignment Proposal
## Details

I want to make a procedurally generated dungeon crawler. Similar to games like the Binding of Issac and spelunky. 
In the game the map, enemies and wepons the player finds are all prcedurally generated. Enemies would spawn using a spawner and come in waves. After a certain number of waves the player will be asked to enter one of three rooms. Each one procedually generated with random weapons and enemy types inside.

### Task list
 - Different dungeons for the map
 
 - Varied enemie types to spawn
 
 - Multiple weapon types
 
 - Will demonstrate ability to use multipe systems and a functions in unity
